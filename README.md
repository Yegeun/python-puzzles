# Python 

Hello name is Yegeun, this folder are some of the problems quirks I have found with Python. This is more of a documentation for myself.

### Problem 1	
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
### Problem 2	
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
### Problem 3	
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
### Problem 4	
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
### Problem 5	
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
What is the 10,001st prime number?
### Problem 6	
Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
 
How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?
### Problem 7	
By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.
3
7 4
2 4 6
8 5 9 3
That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
Find the maximum total from top to bottom in triangle.txt (attached to the email), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.
NOTE: It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 299 altogether! If you could check one trillion (1012) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)
